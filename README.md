Useful scripts to make validators life easier

 <h1>Validator Configuration Script</h1>
    <p>A simple Bash script helps to setup validator nodes. 
    Helps you with blockchain validator's node configurations: verifies the existence of required directories and configuration files, adjusts pruning and indexer settings for optimized performance, and dynamically updates network ports to support multiple instances of the service. The script also provides user-friendly prompts to guide through enabling pruning, selecting service instances, and updating configurations with detailed validation at every step."
